# SimVerb3500

This project was made for my computer semantics subject.
<br>
We analize the [SimVerb3500](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1235/) database with different natural language models, where we try to predict the similarity between the two verbs on a scale of 1-10.
<br>
These are the models used:

- [Word2Vec and GloVe](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data)
- [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)
- [DeBERTa](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-base)
- [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)
